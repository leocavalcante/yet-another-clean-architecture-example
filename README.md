# üìê YACAE

YACAE shows off a proof of concept for a Clean Architecture trying to archive some goals.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è It is not an attempt to make a full distinction between Clean, Onion, Hexagonal, DDD, Screaming, Whatever. You may find some mixed concepts or just some borrowed names.

## Goals

- **Don't put the domain inside a framework's directory structure.**
- Clean Architecture's statement that the Infrastructure layer should be able to be fully replaced without affecting
  internal layers.

## The example

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/todo-list` |  |
